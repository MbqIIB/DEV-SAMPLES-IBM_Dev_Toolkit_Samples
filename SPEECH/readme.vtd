Welcome to the IBM VoiceType Developer's Toolkit for OS/2


INTRODUCTION TO THE TOOLKIT
__________________________________________________________________

The Toolkit helps you develop speech applications for OS/2 by
providing you with:


   - API's
       - Header files ( smxxx.h )
       - Library file ( smapi.lib )
       - Online documentation ( tkasrun.htm)
       - DLL file ( smapi.dll )
   - Programming tools
       - Grammar Compiler ( vtbnfc.exe )
       - FSG utilties ( fsgxxx.exe )
       - Tidygram utility ( tidygram.exe )
       - Grammar Guide ( grammar.htm )

IBM VoiceType for OS/2 shipped as part of OS/2 Warp 4.0.
OS/2 Warp 4.0 with VoiceType installed is required to run
applicatons developed with the VoiceType toolkit.

New features included in this toolkit are: The Grammar compiler, the FSG
utilties, Tidygram utility and the Grammar Guide.  The API header files,
lib file and documenation have been updated from the previous version.

A new api included in this release is SmGetAnnotations.  SmGetAnnotations
allows a developer, who has defined grammars in their application, to
retrieve the annotations associated to that grammar.

The level of smapi.dll which shipped with VoiceType on OS/2 Warp 4.0 does not
include the SmGetAnnotations api.  Therefore, we are including an updated
level of the smapi.dll in this toolkit.  Application developers can
redistribute the smapi.dll with thier applications.  Please refer to
the licensing information in the Using Your Toolkit online book.
