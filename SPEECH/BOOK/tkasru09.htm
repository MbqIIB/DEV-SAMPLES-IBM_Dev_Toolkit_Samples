<P>Logs used for debugging are disabled by default.
Logging is controlled
by the value setting of the parameter api_log_level in the following
VoiceType Dictation host-drive file&#58;
<PRE>
&#40;IBMVType&#41;&#92;spch_bin&#92;engine&#46;cfg
</PRE>
<P>This file should be used for debugging and diagnostics.  The content of the
file is not defined as a public interface.
<P>The value settings for logging are:
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><P><B>&nbsp;0
</B></TD><TD><P>Disables logging
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><P><B>&nbsp;1

After this logging parameter has been changed the engine must be
restarted before the new parameter value can take effect.
<P>Logs of interest are located in the following
IBM VoiceType host-drive directory:

The log file, router.msg,
includes a trace of IBM VoiceType SMAPI calls.
