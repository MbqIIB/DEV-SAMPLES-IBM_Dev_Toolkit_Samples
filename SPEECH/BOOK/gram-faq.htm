<OL>
<LI>I wrote a grammar, What Can I Say description file, and SGL file.
I compiled the grammar and attached the description file, but when
I test my grammar with Voice Manager and the application, the What
Can I Say information does not appear in the What Can I Say window,
and Voice Manager doesn't seem to recognize any of the phrases
generated by my grammar. What's wrong?<p>
Chances are that some of the words in your grammar are not in the
current vocabulary. In order to see if this is the case do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Turn on speech engine logging by editing the file
<TT>x:\vt\spch_bin\engine.cfg</TT> (where <TT>x</TT> is the drive
where speech is installed). Add the line
<PRE>

api_log_level=2

</PRE>
under defaults.
<LI>Open Voice Manager and the application for which you wrote the grammar.
Turn on the microphone and click on the application window. Then exit both
Voice Manager and the application.
<LI>Now examine the file <TT>x:\spch_run\router.msg</TT>. Search for the
string "rc:81". There you will find a list of words that are in your
grammar but not in the current vocabulary.
