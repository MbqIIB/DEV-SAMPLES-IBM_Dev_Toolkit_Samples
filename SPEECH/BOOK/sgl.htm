<H1>A guide to linking grammars to applications</H1>
<p> An SGL file describes a link between an application and a list of
compiled grammars. When Voice Manager starts to navigate an application
it will automatically load the compiled grammars that are defined in
that application's SGL file. The SGL file must be located in the
<TT>spch_ro\langs\<I>lang-code</I>\grammars</TT> subdirectory.
The name of the SGL file must match the
filename of the application. For example, the name of the executable
for the system editor is <TT>E.EXE</TT>, thus the name of the related
SGL would be <TT>E.SGL</TT>. The contents of the SGL file are the line
<PRE>

***Speech Grammar List***

</PRE>

followed by the names of the compiled grammar files, one per line.
For example, suppose you wrote and compiled to grammars---SGRAM.FSG
and MYNUM.FSG---and you would like to have these grammars linked to
the spreadsheet application, SPREAD.EXE.  You would create a file
SPREAD.SGL consisting of the following lines:

<PRE>

***Speech Grammar List***
sgram.fsg
mynum.fsg

</PRE>
<p>
Now whenever Voice Manager navigates the spreadsheet application
the grammars SGRAM.FSG and MYNUM.FSG will automatically be loaded.
