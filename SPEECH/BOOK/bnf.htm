<H1>A guide to writing grammar files</H1>
<p>
<H2>The syntax of grammar rules</H2>
<H3>Symbols</H3>
<p>A grammar files contain both terminal and nonterminal symbols.
Terminals are alphabetic strings. Nonterminals are alphanumeric strings
enclosed in angle brackets. For example, <TT>print</TT>, <TT>move</TT>, and
<TT>select</TT>
are all terminals; <TT>&lt;commands&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;np&gt;</TT>, and <TT>&lt;vp&gt;</TT> are nonterminals.

<H3>Grammar Rules</H3>
<p>The grammar file is a set of context-free rewrite rules. Each
rule contains one nonterminal symbol on the left-hand side of an equals sign
("=") and one
or more terminal or nonterminal symbols on the right-hand side.
Rules must end with a period (".").
Each rule must have a unique left-hand side nonterminal---no two rules
can have identical left-hand sides. For example, the following grammar fragment
is not allowed:
<PRE>
&lt;np&gt; = &lt;pronoun&gt; .
&lt;np&gt; = &lt;determiner&gt; &lt;noun&gt; .
</PRE>
<p>
However, the right-hand side of a rule can contain a list of alternative
rewrites delimited by the "|" character. For example, the above fragment
can be rewritten as:
<PRE>
&lt;np&gt; = &lt;pronoun&gt; | &lt;determiner&gt; &lt;noun&gt; .
</PRE>
(A np can be rewritten either as a pronoun or as a determiner followed by
a noun)
<p>The following symbol-final characters have special interpretations: <p>
<MENU>
<LI> <strong>?</strong> means that the symbol is optional. For example,
     in <TT>change the? font</TT> the <TT>the</TT> is optional.
<A NAME="kleene"><LI> <strong>*</strong>, the Kleene Star,</a> means that there can be zero or more occurrences
     of the symbol. For example, in <TT>&lt;part-number&gt; = &lt;part&gt; &lt;digits&gt;*</TT> there
     can be zero or more occurrences of <TT>&lt;digits&gt;</TT> .
<LI> <strong>+</strong>, the Kleene Plus, means that there can be one or more occurrences of
     the symbol.
</MENU>
<H3>The root nonterminal</H3>
<p>The left-hand-side of the first rule in your grammar defines the root nonterminal.
VoiceType or other speech applications will only recognize phrases that are derived
from this nonterminal. This is illustrated in the following ill-formed grammar fragment:
<PRE>

&lt;move-command&gt; = move &lt;direction&gt; &lt;count&gt; .
&lt:select-command&gt; = select the next &lt;count&gt; words .

    ...

</PRE>

A speech application using this grammar will only recognize phrases derived
from <TT>&lt;move-command&gt;</TT> (<I>move up five, move down six,</I> etc.).
It will not recognize phrases derived from <TT>&lt;select-command&gt;</TT>.
In fact, this grammar will generate the warning
<PRE>

  Non-terminal defined but not referenced
  BNF symbol "&lt;select-command&gt;"


</PRE>


 when you attempt compile it. The above grammar can be corrected by adding
 a grammar initial root nonterminal rule as follows:

 <PRE>

&lt;commands&gt; = &lt;move-command&gt; | &lt;select-command&gt; .

&lt;move-command&gt; = move &lt;direction&gt; &lt;count&gt; .
&lt:select-command&gt; = select the next &lt;count&gt; words .

</PRE>
<H3>Including a grammar within your grammar</H3>
<p> You can include an existing grammar into the grammar file you are writing
by using the INCLUDE keyword on the last line of the new grammar file. For example,
the line<p><p>
<TT>include 'my-numbers.bnf'</TT> <p><p>
will include the rules in "my-numbers.bnf" in the current grammar.
<p><p>A set of commonly used integers (<I>one</I> through <I>twenty</I>, <I>thirty</I>,
<I>forty</I> and <I>fifty</I>) can be made available to your grammar by the special
command <p><p>
<TT>EXTERN &lt;Extern_counts&gt; . </TT>
<p><p>
This line must be after all the grammar rules but before any include statements.
The use of the of the non-terminal <TT>&lt;Extern_counts&gt;</TT> is explained
in <A HREF="annot.htm#counts-annotation">the section on the <TT>@count()</TT> annotation.</A>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<p>Comments can be included in grammar files by use of the comment marker <tt>//</tt>.
All the characters from the comment marker to the end of the line are considered to
be the comment.
<A NAME="annotation"><H3>Annotations</H3></a>
Annotations can be attached to terminal symbols. When an annotated word is recognized
both that word and its annotation are returned to the application. These annotations
may assist the application in parsing the recognized phrases.
Annotations can either be a string or a integer ranging from 0 to 65535. For example,
<PRE>
&lt;september&gt; = September:9 .
&lt;subtract&gt; = subtract:"-" .
&lt;db-query&gt; = list all employees:"list-employees" |
             show all employees:"list-employees" .
</PRE><p>
If you are writing grammars that will be used by Voice Manager, these
annotations can be used to define what actions to take when a given phrase
is recognized.  For information on writing Voice Manager annotations
see the <A HREF="annot.htm">annotations guide</A>.
<H4>Note:</H4>
Annotations that introduce indeterminacy are not allowed. For example,
<PRE>
&lt;command&gt; = set:"[alt f]" the font to courier   |
            set:"[alt c]" the color to blue     .
</PRE><p>
is not allowed.   When the speech engine recognizes "set" it doesn't
know which set is intended: <TT>set:"[alt f]"</TT> or <TT>set:"[alt c]"</TT>.
Often this problem can be eliminated by moving the annotations rightward.
Thus, the above example can be rewritten:
<p>
<PRE>
&lt;command&gt; = set the font:"[alt f]" to courier   |
            set the color:"[alt c]" to blue     .
</PRE><p>
However, this is not always possible. For example, consider the following
problematic grammar:

<p>
<PRE>
&lt;print-command&gt; = print:"[ctrl p]"    |
                  print:"[ctrl p][alt e]" even pages     .
</PRE><p>
This is not allowed because when the speech engine recognizes "print" it
doesn't know which print is intended: <tt>print:"[ctrl p]"</TT> or
<TT>print:"[ctrl p][alt e]"</tt>. Moving the annotation rightward does
not eliminate the problem:

<p>
<PRE>
&lt;print-command&gt; = print:"[ctrl p]"    |
                  print even:"[ctrl p][alt e]" pages     .
</PRE><p>
<I>Print</I> is still ambiguous between <TT>print:"[ctrl p]"</TT> and <TT>print</TT>.
