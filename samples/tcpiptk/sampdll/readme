Sampdll consists of two C programs: MYPROG.C and SAMPDLL.C
(located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\TCPIPTK\SAMPDLL).
SAMPDLL.C demonstrates building a DLL.
MYPROG.C demonstrates the use of a DLL.  When executed, it
returns the IP address of a valid hostname.

Following are details on building and executing the RPC Samples:

(1) To Compile and Link the SAMPDLL.DLL and MYPROG.EXE, type:

      nmake -f vacpp.mak         (to build using the VisualAge C/C++ compiler)

(2) To execute the sample, type:

      myprog hostname
