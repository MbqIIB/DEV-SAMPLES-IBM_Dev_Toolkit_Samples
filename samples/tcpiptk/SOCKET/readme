 SOCKET consists of three client/server samples and SELECTS.C
 (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\TCPIPTK\SOCKET).

 SELECTS.C is a simple TCP and UDP server that uses the BSD
 select() call. MSGC.C/MSGS.C, TCPC.C/TCPS.C and UDPC.C/UDPS.C
 are sample C socket client/server programs demonstrating
 network programming with OS/2 sockets.

 Following are details on building and executing the RPC Samples:

    1. To compile and link the sample programs, type:

         nmake -f vacpp.mak         (to build using the VisualAge C/C++ compiler)

    2. Executing udps.exe and udpc.exe

         a. To start udps server, type:

            start udps

            An additional session is created and the following
            message is displayed:

            Port assigned is 1028


         b. To run udpc client, type:

            udpc 9.67.60.10 1028

            Where:

            9.67.60.10       IP address of machine where udps
                             server is running.

            1028             Port assigned by udps server.

            After executing the udpc client, you will see the
            following output on the server session:

                     Received message Hello ................


    3. Executing tcps.exe and tcpc.exe

         a. To start tcps server, type

            start tcps 2000

            where:

            2000             Port number assigned to tcps server

         b. To run tcpc client, type

            tcpc charm 2000

            where:

            charm            hostname of machine where tcps server
                             is running.

            2000              Port assigned to tcps server.

    4. Executing selects.exe

       The SELECTS server has the same function as the TCPS and
       UDPS servers.

         a. To start the SELECTS server, type:

            start selects 2000

            where:

            2000             Port number assigned to selects server

         b. To run tcpc client, type

            tcpc charm 2000

            where:

            charm            hostname of machine where selects
                             server is running.

            2000             Port assigned to selects server.

         c. To run udpc client, type

            udpc 9.67.60.10 2000

            where:

            9.67.60.10       IP address of machine where selects
                             server is running.

            2000             Port assigned by selects server.

       After executing the udpc client, you will see the following
       output on the server session:

       Received message Hello ................


    5. Executing msgs.exe and msgc.exe

       msgs.c and msgc.c are the same program as udps.c and
       udpc.c except they are written using recvmsg() and
       sendmsg() calls.

         a. To start the msgs server, type:

            start msgs

            An additional session will be created and the following
            message will appear.

            Port assigned is 1028


         b. To run msgc client, type

            msgc 9.67.60.10 1028

            where:

            9.67.60.10       IP address of machine where msgs
                             server is running.

            1028             Port assigned by msgs server.
