SYSCTL
------
The sysctl() call performs special operations on the TCP/IP stack.  Unlike
getsockopt() or setsockopt(), sysctl() accesses and modifies systemwide
parameter values for the entire TCP/IP stack

SAMPLES FOR SYSCTL
------------------

There is one file  named:

Sysctl.c

for explainig sysctl calls. This sample program sets the ipgate 1 and then back
to 0 This can be verified using

inetcfg -g ipforward

which shows the status of ipgate flag being reset back to 0.

COMPILATION
------------
The source code for the sysctl sample can be compiled using the
given makefile

nmake /a

EXECUTION
---------
Execution of sysctl.exe shows the initial value of ipgate and then sets it to
1 and then it resets back to the original value.
