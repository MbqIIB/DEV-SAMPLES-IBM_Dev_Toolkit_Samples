OS2IOCTL
--------
   The new ioctls take only three args, except for the 6 ioctls STATRT,
STATARP, STATAT, STATIF, STATIF42, STATSO. For these ioctls you must link
with tcpip32.dll then you must use os2_ioctl.

   The os2_ioctl() socket call performs special operations on sockets; in
particular, operations related to returning status from kernel.

SAMPLES FOR OS2IOCTL
--------------------

There is one file  named :

os2ioctl.c

for explainig ioctl calls. This sample program issues SIOSTATRT for getting
the routing entries from the routing table and SIOCSSYN to set the SYN attack
prevention function flag ON.  This can be verified using

netstat -r
inetcfg -g syn

which shows the routing table information and  status of SYN flag being set

COMPILATION
------------
The source code for the os2ioctl sample can be compiled using the
given makefile

nmake /a

EXECUTION
---------
Before execution of os2ioctl.exe the SYN flag information should be saved.
After execution of this sample program;

* the SYN flag is set to 1
* the routing table information is displayed
