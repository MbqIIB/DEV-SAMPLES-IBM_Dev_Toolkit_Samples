SENDFILE
--------
The send_file() sends data from the file associated with the open file
handle, directly from the file system cache over the connection associated
with the socket.

SAMPLE FOR SENDFILE
-------------------

There are two exes named

a) recv.exe         - TCP server application
b) sendfile.exe     - TCP client application

for explaining the send_file. The client sends a file to a server.

The server can be started  as follows -

recv  <ip_addr> <port>
where:
a) <ip_addr> - stands for the ip address of the server.
b) <port> - stands for the port number where  the server is to be bound.

The client can be started as follows -

sendfile  <ip_addr> <port> <filename>
where:
a) <ip_addr> - stands for the ip address of the server.
b) <port> - stands for the port number where  the server is bound.
c) <filename> - stands for the file to be sent.


COMPILATION
------------

The source code for the server and the client are in the files
by name -

1) sendfile.c
2) recv.c

These can be compiled by using the makefile given and running
the following command

nmake /a
